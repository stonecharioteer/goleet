	Use:   "leetgo",
	Short: "leetgo is a CLI application to help you study for DSA interviews using Leetcode",
	Long: `leetgo uses spaced repetition to help you decide what to study next for leetcode.
It uses a corpus of leetcode problems to help you study. It can be used to record your
efforts, note how long you took to solve something, how many times you've tried solving a problem,
and accordingly gives you redos or tasks you with revision depending on how
long it has been since you've tackled a problem before.

Leetgo is named after John Lithgow, for the pun.
